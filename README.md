# iOS-App-Project
Just some simple iOS-App Projects with no greater meaning. Just to learn some more Swift. 

- Project 1: Experimenting with Music-Players. A simple Single-View iOS-App that can play songs from the Settlers V Soundtrack. (on master)
- Project 2: TicTacToe-Game: Experimenting with the architecture and keeping a clear MVC-Pattern. 2 Tabs are implemented: 1vs1 and 1vsBot. The Bots strength can be adjusted up to an unbeatable state (like really unbeatable). (on master and dedicated branch)
- Project 3: Experimenting with different UIs and Networking-APIs(Wikipedia). Just some customisation with placeholder images and other stuff. Also added a Wikipedia API to get more meaningfull texts. (on master and dedicated branch)
